Task 3: Number Recognition
-> Number Recognition, also known as the digit recognition or the handwritten recognition of digits is one of the fundamental task in the computer vision and data science.
-> Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects the scanned images of the handwritten digits .
-> Handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of the Neural Network.
-> This system basically detects the scanned images of the handwritten digits.
-> It involves creating a system that can accurately recognize and classify the handwritten digits (usually from 0 to 9) into their respective categories. 
-> This project has various real-world applications, such as digitizing postal codes on envelopes, recognizing handwritten numbers on checks, and assisting in the automation of form processing.
